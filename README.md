# Professional Portfolio

## Credits
The inspiration behind this project was drawn from [Brittany Chiang's](https://github.com/bchiang7) work on her project [V4](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4), the now updated site can be found [here](https://brittanychiang.com/). When browsing portfolio examples I came across her work and eventually [V4](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4). I loved the project so much I wanted to challenge myself to build as much as I could of the website from scratch. Although I have built this website using my own code, the design is [Brittany's](https://github.com/bchiang7) and I do not claim the site as my own. I'm appreciative of the result so far and have learned much attempting to mimic the site as closely as possible. 

I encourage you to check out more of [Brittany Chiang's](https://github.com/bchiang7) amazing work.
